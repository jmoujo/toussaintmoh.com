                <p> With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation
                  process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout
                  the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end
                  user.  
                </p>  
                
                <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
                    communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a projet not only do I work to craft the application
                    according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
                    with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budge</p>
